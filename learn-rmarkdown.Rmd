## Loading data

I'm using the `palmerpenguins` dataset, which we can load through an R package.

@Manual{,
  title = {palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data},
  author = {Allison Marie Horst and Alison Presmanes Hill and Kristen B Gorman},
  year = {2020},
  note = {R package version 0.1.0},
  doi = {10.5281/zenodo.3960218},
  url = {https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/},
}

```{r, eval=TRUE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("allisonhorst/palmerpenguins")
```

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

## Learning some summary functions

There are some useful functions to skim through and compute stats from datasets. Let's try some.

```{r}
install.packages("skimr")
library(skimr)
skim_without_charts(penguins)
```
Another summary function I've recently learned is `summary()`.
What an R beginner like me would do, and actually did, is to just call the function and expect it to work. But R said `Error in summarize(penguins) : could not find function "summarize"`.

- Extra test: <span style="color:blue"> *Does this work for making the font color blue?* text</span>

Do I really need to memorize what package each function I learn belongs to in order to make my time within R more efficient?

For now, I'll install the dplyr package, which is where `summarize()` belongs to.

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
summarize(penguins)
```

Never mind, there seems to be something missing to properly make the data frame *exist* in the same environment where Rmd documents are knitted. I need to learn how to import the data frame into memory in your Rmd document itself, as said by andresrcs [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/r-markdown-object-not-found/140783/3).

Oh, well. At least I learned some markdown.
